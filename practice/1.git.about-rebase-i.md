There was a question about how `git rebase -i` interacts with git history, especially when it has merge commits.

It turns out that the merge commits always disappear and corresponding conflict always happen;
Even if you do not convert any commits from `git rebase -i` into `edit`, it will consistently raise conflict
while doing rebase.

Thanks for students who asked this in the practice session.
